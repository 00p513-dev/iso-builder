Terraform - Debian Live configuration and scripts for generating budgie-remix OS images.

To build an budgie-remix image you'll need to:
 1) Make sure you have the dependencies installed (dctrl-tools dpkg-dev genisoimage gfxboot-theme-ubuntu git-core live-build python-minimal squashfs-tools syslinux syslinux-utils zsync)
 2) Change your working directory to this folder
 3) Configure etc/terraform.conf or leave it as-is
 3) Run ./terraform.sh as root
 4) When done, your images will be in the builds folder
